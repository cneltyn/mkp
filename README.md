LOG734 18V Heuristics in Analytics, HiMolde, Lars Magnus Hvattum (teacher)

Designed and implemented a construction heuristic for the multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP). The heuristic is be able to produce feasible solutions to any instance of the
MKP. The heuristic is to be evaluated based on two main criteria:
  1) the speed of execution
  2) the quality of the solutions obtained
